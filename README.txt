Project Description
• Background
o A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem. A salesman
is given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of
city locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly
one time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also
known as a Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. (See
http://www.tsp.gatech.edu for more info)

• Problem
o You will be expected to use brute force to calculate the minimum cost paths for a
series of problems.
o Data for each problem will be supplied in a .tsp file (a plain text file).

Solved by finding all permutations and calculating the distance of each permutation.
